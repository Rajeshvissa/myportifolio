                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>Problem statement - Improper arrangement of cars in the parking areas.

                    Solution - In this project we have created parking system such that only certain number of slots are available for the vehicle to park based on the availability of parking areas. A barrier will be at the entrance of the parking area and it determines whether the vehicle should be allowed or not based on the availability of parking slots .
                    
                    Knowledge we gain - This is an Arduino based hardware project, In this project I have explored through the micro processor arduino and learned it's working.
                    
                    We have also used IR sensors to detect the presence of cars at entrance and as well as at the parking slots and servo motor as a barrier to allow and disallow the car.
                    
                    Mistakes that we have done : While making the prototype we went through some mistakes. First we have given the power supply to all the five IR sensors through Arduino. but we realised that Arduino cannot be able to supply to five IR sensors with 5V each. Hence we gave separate power supply to all the IR sensors.
                    
                    Knowledge gained : Learned basics of Arduino and it's working. Also gained how the sensors and other electronic devices works with Arduino. 
                    
                    As a whole , I understood that inorder to make a computational device we need a microprocessor to control all the other peripherals and sensors are required to detect and algorithms are required to determine the action of the peripherals through the micro processor.
                    for example: In this project the barrier should allow the vehicle if the slots are available, 
                    behind the scene the IR sensor will detect the presence of vehicle and transfer the information to the Arduino and the algorithms that were injected in the Arduino will check out the availability of slots and then Arduino passes the information to the servo motor ( acting as a barrier) to allow the vehicle or not.
                    
                    I am excited to explore through further more projects and improve my knowledge like this .</p>
